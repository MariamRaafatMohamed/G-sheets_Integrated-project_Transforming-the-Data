# Access to Drinking Water â€“ Part 2: Transforming the Data (2000â€“2020)

This project builds on Part 1 by introducing time-series analysis and deeper insights using extended WHO/UNICEF JMP data across 20 years.

>  Completed as part of the ALX Data Analytics Program  
>  Tool: Google Sheets

---

## Objectives

- Import and clean multi-year water access data
- Join country-region mappings using `Regions.csv`
- Create time-based analysis using year differences
- Calculate Annual Rate of Change (ARC) per area
- Identify progress, stagnation, and full access trends
- Group data by region and summarize average change
- Visualize differences between rural and urban improvement

## Key Features & Logic Used

- `y_diff`: Difference between available years per country
- `ARC_n`, `ARC_r`, `ARC_u`: Annual Rate of Change for basic access (national, rural, urban)
- `wat_bas_* (rounded)`: Cleaned access % columns
- `ARC_*_full`: Boolean flags for countries with full access both years
- `ARC_diff`: Difference between rural and urban ARC
- `region`: Assigned via `LOOKUP()` from Regions.csv

---

## Visualizations

-  Bar chart: ARC by region
-  Histogram: ARC differences (rural vs urban)
-  Pivot tables: Average ARC by region
-  Distribution plots: Full access vs stagnation vs decline

## Key Insights

- Sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind, despite small annual improvements.
- Urban areas still maintain better access, but rural ARC shows steeper growth.
- Some countries show zero progress and no full access â€” urgent action needed.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Time-series analysis with year deltas
- Calculating change rates (ARC) using formulas
- Conditional logic & error handling (`IF`, `IFERROR`, `ROUND`)
- Merging datasets via `LOOKUP`
- Region-level comparison and insight extraction
